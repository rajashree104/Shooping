        Missing: tea Show results with: tearWhen you apply for a software engineer job, it is common for the interviewer to say “Tell me about yourself” at the beginning of an interview. Hiring managers often ask this question to encourage you to introduce yourself and share a short summary of your career.

        Because this question is one of the first in an interview, it's important to answer it successfully. Naturally, by starting the interview well, you can make a good impression and set an optimistic tone for the rest of the discussion.
        
        Although this question seems relatively simple, it can be challenging for candidates to answer effectively. While the question is open-ended, employers generally want you to create a brief yet compelling narrative that sells you as a candidate. They typically want you to discuss your career path, list a few major highlights and end with how your professional past has prepared you for the job in question.

        How to answer “Tell me something about yourself” during a software engineer interview
        When you take time to plan an answer in advance, you can feel confident that you're giving the best possible response. You can respond to the “tell me about yourself” interview question for a software developer by following these six steps:
        
        1. Focus on the job in question
        As you prepare your response, always keep the job you're applying for in mind. Whether you're an entry-level candidate or a senior applicant, make sure the narrative you create leads toward the role in question.
        
        To focus your answer successfully, do some brainstorming. Write down what interests you in the position, such as unique challenges and responsibilities. Then write down what you like about the company, such as its mission or its growth plan.Next, make a list of qualifications that set you apart from the competition. Think about the professional experience you've had and the companies you've worked for. Then make note of your qualities and soft skills, such as your ability to multitask or your strong critical thinking skills.

        Reread the job listing to identify the key qualifications the hiring team is seeking. Then narrow down your list to a few top choices that you'll mention in your response.Begin your self-introduction with an overview of your career, starting with the present. For example, you might say, “I'm an experienced software engineer” to clarify your current level and role.

        Continue the overview with a brief mention of how long you've worked in the field and what kind of work you do. For example, you might say, “I have 10 years of experience developing software systems for First Technologies.”After your overview, discuss a few of the highlights of your career. For example, you might say, “Prior to my current role, I worked as a developer for three years and a programmer for two years.”

        Even if you've had a lengthy career, take care to provide minimal details. Your self-introduction should be concise, and the hiring team can ask additional questions if they want to learn more about something you mentioned.
        
        End your self-introduction by stating your professional goals in the context of the job you're interviewing for. Your conclusion should tell the hiring team both why you want the job and why you're qualified for it. For example, you might say, “In the next 10 years, I'd like to move into a Chief Technology Officer role. A position like this senior software engineer job would let me gain more experience with project management and leadership.”“I'm an experienced software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my seven years in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and I love working with a team. I've also had the opportunity to serve as the software engineer lead for three projects with First Technology.

        “Before my current position, I was a junior software engineer with Mobile First. While working there, I committed to mobile system development, which has been my specialty for seven years. I understand that a major part of this role with your firm focuses on leading mobile development teams, which my previous experience has certainly prepared me for.”While tips and tricks can help you in writing your career objective, drafting a perfect career objective for software engineers can be a daunting task.
